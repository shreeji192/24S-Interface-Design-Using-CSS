            <!-- Intro -->
            <p>(Pitbull) Mr. Worldwide to infinity
            You know the roof on fire
            We gon' boogie, oogie-oggie, jiggle, wiggle and dance
            Like the roof on fire
            We gon' drink drinks and take shots until we fall out
            Like the roof on fire
            Now, baby, give a booty naked, take off all your clothes
            And light the roof on fire
            Tell her, tell her, "Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
            I'm on fire"
            I tell her, "Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
            I'm on fireball"</p>

            <!-- Verse 1 -->
            <p>(Pitbull) I saw, I came, I conquered
            Or should I say, "I saw, I conquered, I came" (Ha-ha)
            They say the chico on fire and he no liar
            While y'all slippin' he runnin' the game
            Now big bang boogie, get that kitty little noogie
            In a nice, nice little shade
            I gave Suzie a little pat up on the booty
            And she turned around and said "Walk this way"</p>

            <!-- Chorus -->
            <p>(John Ryan & Pitbull) I was born in a flame
            Momma said that everyone would know my name
            I'm the best (That's right), you've ever had (That's right)
            If you think I'm burning out, I never am (Yeah)
            I'm on fire (Come here)
            I'm on fire (Come here)
            I'm on fire (Come here)
            I'm on fire

            <p>(Pitbull) Sticks and stones may break my bones
            But I don't care what y'all say
            'Cause as the world turns, y'all boys gonna learn 
            That chico right here don't play (Ha-ha)
            That boy's from the bottom, bottom of the map
            M.I.A U.S.A
            I gave Suzie a little pat up on the booty
            And she turned around and said, "Walk this way"</p>
